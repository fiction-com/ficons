### Motive

To create a drop-in alternative to Font Awesome for people that like a little variety in their icons.

Ficons simply maintains the simple **fa-[icon-name]** class system and leaves the original Font Awesome icons as fallbacks if there is no explicit replacement.

It is a "drop-in" replacement for Font Awesome, which means you can simply replace your Font Awesome CDN link with the Ficons CDN link and you're good to go.

> **TLDR** You can just replace your Font Awesome CDN link with the one from Ficons and everything should work the same, only better.

### Features:

- Get over 200 new or replaced icons
- Minimal and more consistent redesign
- Simple, drop-in replacement for Font Awesome's 'fa-' class system
- Update your site or apps icons in 60 seconds

  patch)
- New additions, including new icons, without breaking backward compatibility
  bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
- Bug fixes, changes to brand logos, and misc changes bumps the patch
